## 💡 Quick Win Demonstration

I've already implemented a **Smart Date Parser** that addresses your primary concern:

### Before (Rigid)
```
deadline submit report /by 31/12/2024 1800
❌ Error: "Task cannot be added. Please enter datetime in the format of 'd/M/yyyy HHmm'"
```

### After (Flexible)
```
deadline submit report /by tomorrow 6pm          ✅ Works!
deadline submit report /by next friday          ✅ Works!
deadline submit report /by Dec 31 6:00 PM       ✅ Works!
deadline submit report /by 31/12/2024 1800      ✅ Still works!
```

### Error Message Improvement
```
❌ Before: "Task cannot be added. Please enter datetime in the format of 'd/M/yyyy HHmm'"

✅ After: "Invalid date/time format. Try these examples:
📅 Exact formats:
  • 31/12/2024 1800
  • 31/12/2024 6:00 PM
  • Dec 31, 2024 1800

🗣️ Natural language:
  • tomorrow 6pm
  • next friday 2:30 PM
  • today 9am
  • monday 3pm"
```
