# CheerpJ Setup for Duke Task Manager

## Problem Solved
The original Duke application used JavaFX, which is not yet fully supported by CheerpJ. This has been converted to a Swing-based application that works perfectly with CheerpJ.

## What Was Changed
1. **Removed JavaFX Dependencies**: Removed JavaFX from build.gradle
2. **Converted to Swing**: Replaced JavaFX UI with Swing components
3. **Removed JavaFX Classes**: Deleted DialogBox.java and MainWindow.java
4. **Updated Main Application**: Created a new Main.java with Swing UI
5. **Fixed Launcher**: Updated Launcher.java to work with the new Main class

## Local Development
1. **Start HTTP Server**: 
   ```bash
   # Use Node.js http-server (supports Range headers)
   npx http-server public -p 8002 --cors
   
   # Note: Python's SimpleHTTPServer doesn't support Range headers!
   ```

2. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8002`

3. **Test Commands**: Try these commands in the application:
   - `help` - Show available commands
   - `list` - List all tasks
   - `todo buy milk` - Add a todo task
   - `deadline submit report /by 31/12/2024 1800` - Add a deadline task
   - `event meeting /at 15/12/2024 1400` - Add an event task
   - `done 1` - Mark task 1 as done
   - `delete 1` - Delete task 1
   - `bye` - Exit the application

## Deployment to Production

### Vercel
```bash
# Option 1: Vercel CLI
cd public && vercel

# Option 2: Connect GitHub repo
# Build Command: (leave empty)
# Output Directory: public
```

### Netlify
```bash
# Option 1: Drag & drop the public folder to Netlify dashboard
# Option 2: Connect GitHub repo with settings:
# Build command: (leave empty)
# Publish directory: public
```

### GitHub Pages
```bash
# Move public contents to root
cp public/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy CheerpJ Duke app"
git push
# Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
```

## Production Considerations
- ✅ **Range Headers**: All major hosting platforms support HTTP Range headers (required by CheerpJ)
- ✅ **CDN Compatibility**: CheerpJ loads from their CDN which works with all platforms
- ✅ **Static Hosting**: Perfect for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Performance**: JAR files are cached for optimal loading
- ✅ **Security**: Includes security headers configuration

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Swing (fully compatible with CheerpJ)
- **CheerpJ Version**: 4.2 (from CDN)
- **Java Version**: Java 11 (configured in cheerpjInit)
- **UI Components**: JFrame, JTextArea, JTextField, JButton, JScrollPane

## Files Structure
```
public/
├── index.html          # CheerpJ loader page
├── duke-V0.2.jar      # Swing-based application JAR
├── _headers           # Netlify headers configuration
└── vercel.json        # Vercel configuration
```

## Why This Works
- CheerpJ has excellent support for Swing and AWT components
- Swing is more mature and stable in browser environments
- No dependencies on JavaFX runtime which has limited browser support
- All UI interactions work smoothly in the browser
- HTTP Range header support for efficient file loading

## Benefits
- ✅ Full compatibility with CheerpJ
- ✅ Works in all modern browsers
- ✅ No Java installation required on client
- ✅ Fast loading and responsive UI
- ✅ All Duke functionality preserved
- ✅ Easy deployment to any static hosting platform
- ✅ Production-ready with proper caching and security headers
